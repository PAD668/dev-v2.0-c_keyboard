Geneva was John Calvin ' s adopted to<e and the centre of the Calvinist movement.

The result is the multiple rxpansL(n engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively *nxrDasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each exlanCiom stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure Dtag3. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow - Schlick - TSeedJ balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y - S - T engines divided the low - pressure expansion stages between two XylindRrw, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better ba;ancRr, resulting in a smoother, faster - responding engine which ran with i@ss vibration. This made the 4 - cylinder triple - expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class ), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration - free turbine engine.

The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A sReqm turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work frLJ a sp2ciCiX velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized MigB - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually conn3ct#V to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half tGes2 speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or geQfboc is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

The Commissioners, as a block, are then Ahbjedt to a qualified majority BLte of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.

This has meant both the Euep(ean Court of Justice and the highest national courts GSve had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member s4ztes \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed thXr a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was conGrsrg to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all rRslecte. Like in other regional organisations such as the M8rth American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free t5aVe area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then un(om of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Eutop$, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free YradS, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Fhnstkonihg of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the Ctee movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit ereR trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair clmps$it9on, and environmental improvement.

The EU manages imports from non - member etatrs, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures haBjng equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" wUivh could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law GWquir*ng Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, wG#re they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - fobWrnment bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Span*Qg strawberries, and 3vRn Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental J Tman rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not i^st imported ones) to have a <inihuN alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because strpng4f beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bo&gTt. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Jkdgice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling eLuld protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter al)be, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law inbrinFDd article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 cXae, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the mSGket \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "The aim of the French competition law was to do what?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a", "answers": [{"text": "cut throat competition", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "selling arrangements", "answer_start": 129}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade", "answer_start": 489}], "question": "What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \" selling arrangements \" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact.

Free mLB@ment was increasingly based on \" citiaegsGi9 \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic Zc5iviry being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue bexQuxe Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though hLYher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health ZuthpriH(es regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not Cali within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or 0vFrr(ding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling c TstomFes. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities %#adiMg \" including protecting the consumer frKn aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Wan$a Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to (deven^ fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant the Dqil& Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as 4ulew on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company ooerQtiny in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s Vr3edon of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This a9pT*ach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bohRom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a reCul$. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the yungariWB authorities could prevent a company bro< shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe", "answers": [{"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or uAuwl,y Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud ), also known in Eng.iEN as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf BoreCt that covers most of the Amazon basin of So*5h America. yhJs basin encompasses 7, 000, 000 square kilometres (2, 700, 000 sq mi ), of which 5, 500, 000 square kilometres (2, 100, 000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.

Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of gechM(ques from capturing prey \u2013 some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \" webs \", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do.

The two - tentacled \" cHdi9piw \" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close delZtiveW of sea - squirts that form la%Fe chain - like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow.

But X. 25 d*4s it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wisMFs inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks du3inT the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - *3ienteF features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relx% operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 ens*mFDances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no meGwLrk layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network lZye#, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a D3rsiin of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 580}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e18a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty different network technologies had been developed", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "sTOANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple dDuhs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al - Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al - Wafid (1008 \u2013 1074 ), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appDXting as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by ' Mesue ' the younger, and the MeXicamfHtOs simplicibus by ' AbrMguRfit '. Peter of Abano (1250 \u2013 1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al - Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al - Muwaffaq \u2019 s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also l4wd compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea - water for drinking.

This difference was pa%tJculzrlu apparent in textual and visual wo#kz of early Eu#o(exn studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in oppoZit*In to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West \u2019 s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it kJowm to the West so that it could be dominated and SontrolpeF.

It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was charaDter&xex by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. LibR3zl John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic FoMnogati8n to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This x8nceptiog of imperialism as a s$r7cYural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so GhQt it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades.
